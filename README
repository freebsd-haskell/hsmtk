Haskell Maintainer's Toolkit
----------------------------

Small utility programs that help your work when maintaining Haskell
ports.

depcalc.hs           -- Inverted dependency calculator (generic), see
                        the EuroBSDCon 2010 paper.

hs-dependencies.sh   -- Generate a list of default inter-dependencies
                        between FreeBSD Haskell ports (requires a
                        cloned freebsd-haskell repository).

hs-depcalc.hs        -- Dependency and topology calculation (forward,
                        backward) for FreeBSD Haskell ports, based on
                        the output generated by hs-dependencies.sh.

merge-trees-sdiff.sh -- Help to integrate the cloned freebsd-haskell
                        repository with the FreeBSD Ports Collection.
