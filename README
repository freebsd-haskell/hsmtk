Haskell Maintainer's Toolkit
----------------------------

Small utility programs that help your work when maintaining Haskell
ports.

depcalc.hs           -- Inverted dependency calculator (generic), see
                        the EuroBSDCon 2010 paper.

hs-dependencies.sh   -- Generate a list of default inter-dependencies
                        between FreeBSD Haskell ports (requires a
                        cloned freebsd-haskell repository).

Depcalc.hs           -- Dependency and topology calculation (forward,
                        backward) for FreeBSD Haskell ports, based on
                        the output generated by hs-dependencies.sh.

merge-trees-sdiff.sh -- Help to integrate the cloned freebsd-haskell
                        repository with the FreeBSD Ports Collection.

hs-ports.hs          -- Miscellaneous utilities to get information about
                        hs- ports.

portversions.sh      -- Get port versions for all Haskell ports in the tree.

pkgversions.sh       -- Get package versions for all Haskell ports in the
                        tree.

Changes.hs           -- Generate list of changes on each Subversion
                        integration.

get_hackage_log.sh   -- Download and convert index.tar.gz of Hackage to a
                        simplified file for hsupdater to consume.

checkout-hs-ports.sh -- Check out lang/ghc and all of the Haskell Cabal ports
                        from the FreeBSD Subversion repository
